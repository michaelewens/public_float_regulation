# Summary

This repository contains data and some code for the research paper "[Regulatory Costs of Being Public: Evidence from Bunching Estimation](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pdv8n/)" (Ewens, Xiao and Xu).

## Public float data

We collect public float data from firms' 10-K filings.  These filings disclose the market value of all outstanding common equity (voting and non-voting) held by non-affiliates at the end of the second fiscal quarter.  [The data](https://github.com/michaelewens/public_float_regulation/blob/main/public_float.csv) (`public_float.csv`) contains `cik` (SEC identifier), the year (`publicfloat_year`) and public float in millions (`publicfloat_mil`)

## Length of 10-K and 10-KSB parts: small firms, 1994-2007

Coming soon.
